# VisionX

## Introduction
VisionX is an innovative platform designed to enhance collaboration among developers and experts across various domains. Leveraging blockchain technology, VisionX introduces a unique token-based system that facilitates secure, transparent, and efficient interactions between users.

## Key Features
- **Developer Collaboration**: Connect and collaborate with developers or domain experts by paying tokens.
- **Blockchain-Based Tokens**:
  - **Predefined Tokens**: Available for users who prefer not to create their own tokens.
  - **User-Created Tokens**: Experienced developers can create custom tokens after reaching a certain collaboration threshold.
- **Special Tags and Custom Tokens**: Users with a high number of collaborations receive special tags, unlocking the ability to create custom tokens.
- **Events and Rewards**: Earn tokens by participating in events organized by companies or the VisionX community.

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Flask for templating and server-side rendering.
- **Backend**: Developed using Python and Flask, integrated with Supabase for database management and authentication.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes Solidity for smart contracts and Web3.py for blockchain interactions.
- **Database**: Managed through Supabase, leveraging PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **Authentication**: Secured with Supabase Authentication, ensuring robust user verification and management.
